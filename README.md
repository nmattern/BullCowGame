# BullCowGame
## This game is the first part of a Udemy course created by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi found here: https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/ .
It assists in providing a fundamental understanding of c++ assuming some prior expierence and follows the Unreal Engine coding standards. 
A link will be provided to a showcase of the game hosted on repl.it when it is completed. 
I also eventually plan on expanding the functionality of the game and will create a TODO list upon completion.
